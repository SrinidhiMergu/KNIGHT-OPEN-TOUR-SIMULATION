# Knight's Open Tour Simulation

Developed simulation of Knight's Tour with Warnsdorff's algorithm using Pygame library.
The knight piece must visit every square without repeats in an m x m board.
In Warnsdorff's Algorithm
- Move the knight to the position which has the least possible moves. 
- Keep visiting the unvisited squares till knight visits each square of the board.

We used Object Oriented programming in python to write the code.
For python GUI, we used Pygame library as it contains all the necessary inbuilt functions
