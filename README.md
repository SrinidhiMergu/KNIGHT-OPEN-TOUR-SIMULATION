# Knight's Tour

- We developed a simulation of knight's tour with the help of Warnsdorff's algorithm. 
- The knight must visit every square without repeat for an m x m board
- We mainly used object oriented programming and python
- For python GUI, we used Pygame library as it contains all the necessary inbuilt functions
